# Overview #

As of mwc-wallet 3.2.2, atomic swaps are supported by the mwc-wallet. This feature will allow users to exchange MWC coins for 
any Secondary currency from the supported currency list. The swap trade workflow is controlled by the wallet and can be run in 
manual or automatic mode. 

This document explains how Atomic Swaps can be done in automatic mode. Please note, there is also a manual mode that allows 
the user to run a swap trade step by step and use files for message exchanges. 

We strongly recommend the use of automatic mode for the standard swaps.

# Configuration #

The configuration includes some parameters in the mwc-wallet.toml.  Every secondary supported currency will require 
it's own node to monitor the blockchain and process transactions with a secondary currency. Default values point to the 
community node, you can install your own to get more security. 

```

# ElectrumX Node URI needed for atomic swap. For every coin expected 4 instances:
# mainnet primary, mainnet secondary, testnet primary, testnet secondary,
# Key: <coin>_[main|test]_[1|2]
# value: URI  
swap_electrumx_addr = [ ("btc_test_1", "52.23.248.83:8000"), 
                    ("btc_test_2", "52.23.248.83:8000") ]

```

# Atomic swap workflow #

First, the Seller (the person who is selling MWC coins) and the Buyer (the person who is buying  MWC coins) need to contact each other to define the
exchange rate and amounts of coins to exchange. They will also need to exchange wallet addresses (atomic swaps can use mwcmqs or tor for 
communications). 

The Atomic swap is started by the Seller (the person who want to sell MWC coins and buy some other type of coin). The seller should specify 
the swap trade parameters and Buyer destination address. The seller can use the `swap_start` command to create a swap trade.
Please note, this command will not start the atomic swap trade.

This example creates an atomic swap trade where 5.6 MWC traded to 0.087 BTC. MWC transactions will require 500 confirmations, and
BTC transactions will require 6 confirmations. The time interval required for the message exchange and redeem are 1 hour (60 minutes).
The BTC redeem address is n4GUrta1qhA1Zgy4DUkmDgxULtJKjDhEc6. The seller will lock the funds first.

# Cancellation #

The swap trade can be cancelled at the starting stage, until the buyer has posted a redeem transaction. Depending on the stage of this transaction,
waiting for refund might be required.

In this example the Buyer didn't lock any funds yet, so his trade is cancelled immediately. 
```
mwc-wallet> swap --adjust cancel  -i 975ab0c2-27f5-45bd-99f2-2c3b01ce0fa5
Swap trade 975ab0c2-27f5-45bd-99f2-2c3b01ce0fa5 was successfully adjusted. New state: Buyer swap was cancelled, nothing was locked, no need to refund
Command 'swap' completed
mwc-wallet> Swap Trade 975ab0c2-27f5-45bd-99f2-2c3b01ce0fa5: Swap trade is finished
```

The Seller already locked MWC, so he will need to wait about 20 hours and 55 minutes to redeem the funds after canceling the swap.
```
mwc-wallet> swap --adjust cancel -i 975ab0c2-27f5-45bd-99f2-2c3b01ce0fa5
